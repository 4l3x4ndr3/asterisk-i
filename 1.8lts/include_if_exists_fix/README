Description:

A new configuration file directive to include another file, but only if it exists. That is, if it's missing, it would not result in hard error. 
This is especially useful, to have "#include my_sip_users.d/*.conf" or similar to work properly even if the directory is empty.

It implements new "#-include".

This patch is based on an already existent patch for asterisk version 10.0.0
